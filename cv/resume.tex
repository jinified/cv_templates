    \section{\mysidestyle Education}

    \textbf{National University of Singapore}, Singapore \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Computer Science} 3.80 GPA \hfill \textbf{Aug 2013 -- May 2017}\\
    Specialized in Artificial Intelligence and highly interested in machine
    learning, data science and computer vision.

    \section{\mysidestyle Working\\Experience}

    \textbf{Bumblebee}, Singapore \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Computer vision developer} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2014 -- May 2017}\\
    A student-driven project that engineer autonomous system, AUV (Autonomous
    Underwater Vehicle) for underwater application. The object recognition and
    tracking system uses OpenCV, Scikit-learn, ROS (Robot Operating System) and
    Python. The AUV is equipped with the capability to identify objects
    underwater and classify them for operational use.
    
    \textbf{HubTurbo}, Singapore \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software developer} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2016 -- May 2016}\\
    A desktop companion for Github Issue Tracker, one of the project accepted by Google Summer of
    Code. Upgraded the UI and integrated headless testing to improve robustness
    of UI testing.

    \section{\mysidestyle Awards\\Participations}

    \textbf{2nd Place, 18th International Robosub Competition}\\
    An international AUV competition participated by almost 40 schools with top
    schools such as Cornell and UC Berkeley. Collaborated with students from
    different disciplines to design a vision framework to track objects under
    perturbed underwater conditions.

    \textbf{Google Summer of Code 2014}\\
    Contributed to development of acoustics localization code of
    \textbf{Bumblebee} project. The acoustics framework is responsible for
    accurate localization of underwater pinger which is applicable to air crash investigation.

    \textbf{Student Achievement Award, National University of Singapore}\\
    Bronze award for representing National University of Singapore in 18th
    International Robosub Competition.
